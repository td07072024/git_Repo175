Some taxonomists include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica),[2] with both species being grouped together as the fallow deer, while others treat it as a different species (D. mesopotamica).[1] The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was once classified as Dama virginiana and the mule deer or black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as Dama hemionus; they were given a separate genus in the 19th century.
